### Custom Header Files:
Based on how the author structures their documents.

+ `basicstyles:` What does this do?

### Outdated/Broken Projects:
The following are broken or outdated for various reasons. Either I have simply not updated them in a while, or their dependencies have been updated and no longer backwards compatible, or there are major unchecked bugs, or they are simply incomplete, etc.
+ `noether`: For assignments, exercises and example sheets.

### One-Off Projects:
+ `cambridge-schedules`: An attempt at re-creating the Cambridge Maths Tripos Schedules PDF in Latex. Keeping it easy to use.
