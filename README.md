A (growing) handmade collection of latex templates, classes and style files.

---

### Currently Active Projects:
+ `wade`: For simple yet elegant letters.
+ `hilbert`: For beautiful yet simple books. (Not aimed to be maths-heavy).
+ `dirac`: For beautiful and sophisticated books. Primarily academic. Highly customisable.
+ `witten`: A unique two-column landscape layout for books and notes. Primarily academic. Highly customisable.
+ `penrose:` An elegent but broadly applicable class for general purpose articles.
+ `salam:` Inspired by certain OUP books, but made for articles and handouts.

### Outdated/Broken Projects:
The following are broken or outdated for various reasons. Either I have simply not updated them in a while, or their dependencies have been updated and no longer backwards compatible, or there are major unchecked bugs, or they are simply incomplete, etc.
+ `noether`: For assignments, exercises and example sheets.

### One-Off Projects:
+ `cambridge-schedules`: An attempt at re-creating the Cambridge Maths Tripos Schedules PDF in Latex. Keeping it easy to use.
